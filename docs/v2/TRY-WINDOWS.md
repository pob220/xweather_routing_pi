# Try xWeatherRouting 2.2.0 on Windows

Please try the new passage-planning screen and tell Paul what feels clear,
confusing or missing. **You do not need to compile anything for this first look.**

## Download and open

1. [Download the Windows 64-bit trial ZIP (about 82 MiB)](https://github.com/pob220/xweather_routing_pi/releases/download/windows-ui-trial-2.2.0/xWeatherRouting-2.2.0-Windows-UI-Trial.zip).
2. Right-click the ZIP and choose **Extract All** into a new folder on your
   Desktop, then open that extracted folder.
3. Double-click **Start-Weather-Routing.cmd**. Allow a few seconds for the
   Weather Routing window to open in the included OpenCPN test copy.

The ZIP includes a matching 64-bit OpenCPN and the plugin, already enabled.
It keeps its settings and test files in the extracted folder. Your normal
OpenCPN, plugins, charts and routes are left alone. Use the supplied launcher
each time. To remove the trial, close its windows and delete that extracted folder.

## First calculation — no weather download needed

1. On **Plan passage**, choose **Passage actions → Try an example passage**.
2. Close the planning-help note and click **Calculate route**.
3. Look at the result, then try **Edit route**, **Boat and polar library** and
   **Passage settings**. Change something and calculate again.

The example selects the illustrative 40 ft monohull and bundled Climatology.
Climatology describes typical seasonal conditions, not today's forecast.
No separate Climatology or Polars plugin is needed for this exercise.

If you want to try one of your own OpenCPN routes, add test charts and a copy
of the route to this test copy first. Then try **Use OpenCPN route**, or its
right-click routing action. The trial starts without your personal charts/routes.

## What changed in 2.2?

- New passages default to **Auto**, with all six engines checked for **Auto**
  and **All**. Saved mode and checkbox choices are remembered for the next
  route and after restarting. Existing routes retain their own settings.
- Shorter settings pages, with tooltips, Help buttons and F1 help.
- Scrollable settings that remember window size and position.
- Clear, separate wind/wave and search-preset resets.
- Direct access to Routes and analysis, reports, statistics and plots.
- Session run records with inputs, outcomes and observed timings, ready to copy
  or save. The production routing algorithms and budgets are unchanged.

## What feedback would help?

- Is it obvious what to do in **Route, Boat and Weather** to get a calculation?
- Are the boat/weather choices and readiness messages understandable?
- What feels awkward, takes too many clicks, or is difficult to read?

Screenshots and the steps that confused you are useful. Please mention your
Windows display scaling if anything is clipped or too small. The aim of this
first look is feedback on using the interface; a build-system review is optional.

The trial contains OpenCPN 5.15.0 / wxWidgets 3.3.4 and xWeatherRouting 2.2.0.
It is separate from the stable 1.x catalogue version. Custom chart-aware hosts
can be tested separately. For source builds, see [Windows developer instructions](WINDOWS.md).

The review ZIP has passed native Windows checks of both matching host
builds, the delivered launcher, relocated-profile calculations and preservation
of a normal OpenCPN profile. See [the validation record](VALIDATION-2.2.md).
